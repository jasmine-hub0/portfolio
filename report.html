      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This project involved designing and building a personal portfolio website using semantic HTML5 only, without any CSS styling. The website consists of four interconnected pages: Home (index.html), About, Projects, and Contact. The goal was to apply semantic tags properly to enhance accessibility, structure, and clarity.

      <p>
